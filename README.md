Problem
This course takes a coding-focused approach towards learning. In each notebook, we'll focus on solving one problem, and learn the techniques, algorithms, and data structures to devise an efficient solution. We will then generalize the technique and apply it to other problems.

In this notebook, we focus on solving the following problem:

QUESTION 1: Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.



This may seem like a simple problem, especially if you're familiar with the concept of binary search, but the strategy and technique we learning here will be widely applicable, and we'll soon use it to solve harder problems.
